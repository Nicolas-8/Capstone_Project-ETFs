Problem description / background discussion (who would be interested in this project)
-	(Passive) Investors might want to over-/underweight, or even exclude certain countries from their portfolios from time to time due to their negative performance in the past and for increased portfolio return in the future.
Such data in a choropleth map might be supportive for the sales management department of a bank and helps identifying regions of interest for the sales of ETFs tracking such indices.  A heat map would show consistent returns over few years for an additional investment argument.

For week 2 I need a solution how to over-/underweight the Top 5 positive return performers and over-/underweight the Worst 5 positive return performers, or vice versa, to see which strategy work best.
